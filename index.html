<h3>Favorite CMSC subject so far and why</h3><p> CMSC 123; I actually enjoyed the course and learned a lot about data structures and had a lot of fun coding in C. This subject is actually only the Computer Science Subject that I had a final grade of 1.00</p>
<h3>Favorite GE so far and why</h3><p> ARTS 1; The reason why I loved the subject was not mainly because of the topics but because of the professor. I did not expect to enjoy the subject but my professor made it fun.</p>
<h3>Favorite PL and why</h3><p> C++; This is actually the first programming language that I encountered when I was Grade 8. I have a hate/love relationship with this language because of its difficulty but I always come back to it because it is my comfort programming language.</p>
<h3>favorite food</h3><p> Pork Binagoongan</p>
